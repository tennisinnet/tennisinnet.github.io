       <h1 style="color:green;">Roger Federer in Doha!! What are we predicting? Can he win?</h1>
       <p>Roger Federer landed to Doha a few days ago and he is been training very hard <br>to return in his best form. It has been more than a year that we don't see Roger <br>Federer playing tennis and all the fans are very excited for his return.</p>
       <img src="Federer.jpg" width="900" height="504">
       <h5>What are we predicting?</h5>
       <p>Federer won't play the first turn and will directly pass to the round of 16 becase<br> he is the number two seed. Afterwards in his first match he will face the winner <br>between Chardy and Evans. Even if he hasn't been playing for a long time<br> we think that he will reach the semi-finals easily.But in the semi-finals<br> Shapovalov or maybe Coric could struggle him but we think that he will <br>beat them too. So what is our prediction?</p>

       <p>We think that Federer will make it to the final but we are not sure that he can win. <br>It depends from who he will face in the final. Potennial players to reach the final<br> are Thiem and Rublev and these two could beat Federer. Especially Rublev <br>who has already won his second title, if youu want to know more about it <a href="./index.html">click here</a> <br>Our final prediction is that Federer will arrive second losing in the final agaisnt Rublev <br>or maybe Thiem.</p>
